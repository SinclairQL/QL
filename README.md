# Sinclair QL Projects

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL</a> is a Personal Computer produced by Sinclair Research from 1984 until 1986. Originally marketed for serious home and small business users, it had the following specifications:

* Motorola MC68008 processor (8-bit databus, 32-bit internal architecture) at 7.5 MHz;
* 128 kB (officially expandable to 640 kB, in practice 896 kB);
* Graphics: 512x256x4 colours or 256x256x8 colours with windowing;
* Storage: 2 Microdrives (endless tape) with 110K capacity each;
* Operating System: QDOS (an in-house development) supporting pre-emptive multitasking

After the QL was discontinued in 1986, many hard- and software extensions like memory and disk add-ons were produced by small independent manufacturers. In the 1990s, QL emulators and alternative operating systems like Minerva and SMSQ/E appeared. An example of this is the <a href="https://www.kilgus.net/qpc/">QPC</a> Windows application that runs an SMSQ/E environment. You can use this to run your old QL applications but it also offers high-resolution graphics and even a TCP/IP device.
